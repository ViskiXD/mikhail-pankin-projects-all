## Abstract

This research investigates the effectiveness of embodied gesture-to-audio parameter mapping through three interconnected case studies: a Unity-based physics installation (*Tiny Soup*), a modern tape delay audio processor (*Extra Echo*), and a granular composition demonstrating tool-feedback loops (*GRE*). The work addresses fundamental questions about how physical gesture interfaces can enhance musical expression beyond traditional knob-based paradigms, with particular focus on real-time parameter control precision, user learning curves, and creative workflow integration.

## 1. Research Questions & Hypotheses

### Primary Research Questions:

**RQ1:** *How does embodied gesture mapping (physical tilt) compare to traditional direct manipulation (knobs/sliders) for real-time audio parameter control precision?*

**RQ2:** *What are the learning curves and user preference patterns when transitioning from conventional audio interfaces to physics-based interaction paradigms?*

**RQ3:** *How do custom tool development workflows influence compositional practices and creative outcomes in electronic music production?*

### Research Hypotheses:

**H1:** Physical gesture mapping will show lower precision but higher user engagement compared to traditional interfaces, with effectiveness varying by parameter type (continuous vs. discrete).

**H2:** Users will demonstrate measurable learning improvement in gesture-audio coordination over repeated sessions, with plateau effects after 15-20 minutes of interaction.

**H3:** Compositional workflows incorporating custom-built tools will exhibit different structural characteristics than those using only commercial software, measurable through tempo variation, harmonic complexity, and rhythmic emergence patterns.

## 2. Literature Review & Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Embodied Cognition in Musical Interfaces

This research builds upon foundational work in embodied musical interaction:

- **Tanaka & Knapp (2002)**: Multimodal interaction in music using gesture and speech
- **Wanderley & Orio (2002)**: Evaluation of input devices for musical expression
- **Marshall & Wanderley (2006)**: Vibrotactile feedback in DMI design
- **Jensenius (2007)**: Action-sound types in music performance

**Theoretical Position:** Following Gibson's affordance theory and Dourish's embodied interaction framework, this work investigates how physical gesture creates more intuitive mappings between intention and sonic outcome than abstract digital interfaces.

### 2.2 Real-Time Audio Parameter Control

**Research Context:**
- Hunt & Kirk (2000): Mapping strategies for musical performance
- Wessel & Wright (2002): Problems and prospects for intimate musical control
- Jord√† (2004): Digital lutherie craftsmanship and musical instruments

**Gap Identification:** Limited research exists on physics-simulation-based parameter control where gesture intention must account for simulated physical constraints (momentum, friction, gravity) rather than direct mapping.

### 2.3 Creative Tool Development Impact

**Theoretical Framework:**
- Winner (1980): "Do Artifacts Have Politics?" - Technology shapes creative possibilities
- Norman (1988): Design of Everyday Things - Affordances in tool design
- Magnusson (2009): Of sonic affordances - How technology constrains creative expression

**Research Positioning:** Investigating the bidirectional relationship between tool creation and musical composition through controlled case study methodology.
